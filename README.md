This is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) 
with Cloudinary integration for image uploads. The project is structured into three main folders: `client`, `server`, and `output`. 
The `client` folder contains the front-end React application, the `server` folder contains the back-end Express application, 
and the `output` folder contains any generated output files or build artifacts. 
The application allows users to create new entries with image uploads, view a list of entries with their images, edit existing entries, and delete entries from the list. 
Images are uploaded and stored using Cloudinary. To run the application, install the necessary dependencies in both the `client` and `server` directories using `npm install`, 
set up the environment variables for MongoDB and Cloudinary in a `.env` file in the `server` directory, and start the server and client using `npm start`. 
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.
